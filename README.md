## Why Customers 'Go Dark'
- Why customer disengage.  Not all reasons are bad
- Things to ask yourself before you panice

1. Are you chasing the right person.  Is the person still with the company.  Has there been a change in role or responsibilities
2. What other things are happening in the customer's world.  Is it a busy time of year for that customer.  Maybe they have other higher priority things on their plate right now.
3. Are you sure that this lack of engagement is unusual.  What is the personality type?  What are their communications preferences(email vs phone, etc.)?  Colud they have things going on outside of work that are relevant?
4. Is the actual problem the way you are trying to engeage? Do you only 'reach out' when its time for renewal? How does your customer recieve value from previous enagements? Have you tailored your approached based on what you know about the customer?

- Lack of engagement is often caused by things outside of your control.  Common for customer to drop off radar from time to time.  Conceern when it lasts for months.
- Need regular form of engagemenat to build trust and deliver value

- Lack of enagement is often a sympton of things outside of your control.
- But its your job to understand what a 'typical' level of engagement looks like for each of your accounts.  Different levels of enagement within the account.  Has the level engagement changed.  Look at relative level of engagement.

## Strategies for Re-engagement
Four compoents to a successful customer engagement.

1. The correct message
2. Delivered to the right person
3. Is the timing correct
4. Via the correct channel

### The correct message
1. What is your goal for engaging.  To collect information? TO deliver value?  To feel better?  Becareful not to mistake your goals for the customer's goals.  Deliver value for every interaction with the cusotmer.  Delivering zero value is sure-fire way to make future engagements harder.  Try to deliver value in every interaction.  Three interactions from worse to better.
      - I thought I'd drop you an email and see how things are going.  When we can chat? - This very generic that customer see all the time.
      - I'd like to offe my assistanc with helping you get more value out of our product.  When can we chat? - Feels genereic, doesn't offer more than the previous
      - I was reviewing your account and noticed your not using this features.  In our experience, this feature reduces the time to do x or y by 40%.  When can we chat.
2. Who is the right person to deal with.  The right person depends on your goal for the interaction.  What is the quality of your existing relationship
3. When is the right time to reach out.  Beware of seasonality.  Think about monthly work cycles  Even a day of the week can make a difference.
4. What's the best way to reach out.  Every person resonds differently to different channels.  Think about cadence of follow up.  Don't be a pest.

Closer to an art then a science.  Understand your customers, How they think, operate and commmunicate.  It's trial end error.

## Preparing to re-engage
When you are re-enaged with a disengaged customer you have limited changes for success

1.  Do some research.  Check for recent social media posts.  What do they care about.  Speak to your collegues to identify all recent touchpoints.  Chekc product usage
2.  Craft a relevant message.  Build rapport by finding common ground. Deliver some free value with every interaction with ever Phone call, email, etc.  Share some feature they may not know about.  Share an blog or article post  Tease some additional value - give some value, but hold some value back.  Be clear on your 'ask'.  Make the call to action frictionless.
3.  Pick your channel.  Email or phone...  Hybrid approach
4.  Timing is everything.  Look for clues when your customer is likely to respond.  Use email tracking to get visibility into when your email has been read.

- Measure effectivenss of different approaches..  Keep iterating... try different times, channels,
- Share learnings with colleagues


### For Emergency Use Only
- some are sneaky and only works once.  What warrants emergency use?  If you have to do this, what's the root cause?  What's the issue with the relationship.
1. Food or gift delivery.
2. Social Media pings.
3. Phone a friend or colleague within the company
4. Call from a different phone number
5. Arrange a 'chance' meeting
